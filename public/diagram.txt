Data Flow in Game of Thrones Website

Component Diagram
Below is a simplified diagram showing the major components of the website and how data is passed between them:

App Component (State Management)
│
├── Header (Receives active user data via props)
│
├── HeroSection (Receives global state data via props)
│
├── BookSection (Receives books data from state, allows state updates)
│
└── SeasonsSection (Receives seasons data from state, allows state updates)

Each component receives data from the App component, where the global state is managed using useState. 
This setup allows each component to be updated independently when the state changes, ensuring a reactive and dynamic user experience.
